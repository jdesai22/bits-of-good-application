                            In high school, he enjoyed teaching STEM to local students, competing on the soccer team, and building frisbee-throwing robots.
                            By teaching courses from Arduino, 3D Modeling, and Math, Jai was able to share his passion for STEM with local students.
                            In the process, he was able to help them build their own exciting projects.
